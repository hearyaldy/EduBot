- [ ] API keys are rotated regularly (every 90 days recommended)
- [ ] No API keys are logged or printed in production
- [ ] API keys have minimum required permissions only
- [ ] Backup access method exists (multiple team members with access)

## ‚úÖ Code Security

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in source code
- [ ] Debug mode is disabled in production builds
- [ ] Sensitive logs are disabled in production
- [ ] Error messages don't expose internal details
- [ ] Input validation is implemented for user data

## ‚úÖ Data Privacy

- [ ] Images are processed locally when possible
- [ ] No homework images are permanently stored
- [ ] User data is encrypted at rest
- [ ] Minimal data is sent to external APIs
- [ ] COPPA compliance measures are in place

## ‚úÖ App Store Security

- [ ] Production builds use release configurations
- [ ] Debug symbols are stripped from release builds
- [ ] App signing certificates are secured
- [ ] Store listings don't expose technical details
- [ ] Privacy policy is comprehensive and accessible

## ‚úÖ Network Security

- [ ] All API calls use HTTPS
- [ ] Certificate pinning is implemented (recommended)
- [ ] Request/response validation is in place
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented
- [ ] Network timeouts are properly configured

## ‚úÖ Monitoring & Incident Response

- [ ] Usage monitoring is in place
- [ ] Error tracking is configured
- [ ] API usage alerts are set up
- [ ] Incident response plan exists
- [ ] Team knows how to rotate compromised keys

## üö® Red Flags - Never Do This

‚ùå **Commit `.env` files to version control**
‚ùå **Share API keys in Slack/email/chat**
‚ùå **Use production keys in development**
‚ùå **Log sensitive information**
‚ùå **Store user data unnecessarily**
‚ùå **Skip input validation**
‚ùå **Use HTTP instead of HTTPS**
‚ùå **Hardcode any secrets in code**

## üîß Security Tools & Commands

### Check for committed secrets:
```bash
# Look for potential secrets in git history
git log --all --full-history -- .env
git log --all --full-history -p | grep -i "api_key\|secret\|password"
```

### Validate environment setup:
```bash
# Run the app and check console for configuration issues
flutter run --debug

# Analyze code for security issues
flutter analyze
```

### Pre-deployment checklist:
```bash
# Ensure no debug code in production
grep -r "debugPrint\|print\|console.log" lib/

# Check for hardcoded credentials
grep -r "sk-\|api_key\|secret" lib/ --exclude-dir=test

# Verify build configuration
flutter build apk --release --verbose
```

## üìã Team Security Practices

### For Developers:
1. **Never commit `.env` files**
2. **Use separate API keys for each environment**
3. **Review code for security issues before commits**
4. **Keep dependencies updated**
5. **Follow the principle of least privilege**

### For DevOps/Deployment:
1. **Use CI/CD secrets management**
2. **Implement automated security scanning**
3. **Monitor API usage and costs**
4. **Set up alerts for unusual activity**
5. **Regularly audit access permissions**

### For Project Managers:
1. **Include security in sprint planning**
2. **Budget for security tools and audits**
3. **Ensure team security training**
4. **Plan for incident response**
5. **Review third-party service agreements**

## üÜò Incident Response

### If API Keys Are Compromised:

1. **Immediately revoke the compromised keys**
2. **Generate new API keys**
3. **Update environment configurations**
4. **Review usage logs for unauthorized activity**
5. **Notify team and stakeholders**
6. **Update any affected deployments**
7. **Conduct post-incident review**
